<ul>
  <li>Open-Source: Anyone can improve this site (<a href="#" onclick="loadPage('contribute')">Learn more</a>)</li>
  <li>No DMCA: While much pirate-work is lost around the web because some sites (ie: KAT) execute DMCA requests, by using ZeroNet this site is not hosted anywhere, so there is no need for it to comply with the DMCA requests in order to keep online.</li>
  <li>Offline: All ebook torrents indexed in your local machine. No need for VPNs, proxies, etc.</li>
  <li>One site to rule them all: You don't need to search for the ebook you are looking for on 10+ sites in order to find it. As everyone contributes soon enough this site will be indexing all of them so you have one place to go to find your ebook.</li>
  <li>All your base are belong to us: This site is <strong>OURS</strong>. Anyone can improve it and submit content. Nobody owns it. Just like a forum any user will soon be able to add content.</li>
